Digify CX Group – Overview
The digify CX Group is a multi-brand Customer Experience (CX) and AI solutions group comprised of four key entities: CX Experts, digify BPO, Outbound CX, and CX Leads. Founded in South Africa by Phillip Batt (Founder & CEO), the group has grown from a local consultancy into a global ecosystem supporting organizations across the UK, US, Australia, the Middle East, and Africa. Together, these brands deliver end-to-end CX services – from strategic Zendesk consulting and technology integration to 24/7 support operations, outbound sales campaigns, and digital marketing. In 2025, the group expanded significantly – launching new brands, welcoming international clients, and becoming officially accredited Zendesk AI Experts. Moving into 2026, the digify CX Group’s mission is to scale innovation in CX with more AI and automation, more global clients, and more South African talent trained and deployed to world-class CX work. The group’s core values emphasize customer-centric excellence, innovation, integrity, collaboration, social impact, and continuous learning
, fostering a culture where employees are empowered and clients are treated as partners – never “just a number”
. Below is a structured overview of each brand (with overlapping services clearly noted), organized by key website sections: Homepage/Overview, Services, Team/Bios, Pricing, Testimonials/Case Studies, Brand Identity & Tone, and Mission & Strategic Direction.

Overview (Homepage Content)
CX Experts is the longest-standing brand in the portfolio – a specialist Zendesk consultancy and solutions provider. As South Africa’s top Zendesk partner, CX Experts empowers businesses to deliver exceptional customer service and contact center experiences
. The team designs, implements, and optimizes tailored support solutions that drive growth, boost efficiency, and foster lasting customer relationships
. Whether a client is implementing Zendesk for the first time or enhancing a mature deployment, CX Experts provides end-to-end guidance with certified expertise at every step
. Founded by Phillip Batt – who also leads the digify CX Group – CX Experts has grown from a small consultancy into a trusted advisor for organizations worldwide, while still proudly serving as South Africa’s #1 Zendesk partner. The CX Experts team is known for marrying global best practices with local insight, and for championing digital transformation & exceptional customer experiences in all engagements.
Services & Capabilities
As a Premier Zendesk Partner, CX Experts offers a full spectrum of services to ensure companies get maximum value from Zendesk and modern CX tech:
Zendesk Licensing & Resale: As a top-tier reseller, CX Experts advises on the right Zendesk product mix and manages licensing, often bundling value-added services (the team’s software sales are a major revenue stream).
Implementation & Onboarding: End-to-end setup of Zendesk instances – configuring workflows, forms, fields, triggers, SLAs, and integrations – to quickly stand up efficient support systems. This includes help center setups, custom app integration, and ensuring best-practice configuration
.
Optimization & Health Checks: Ongoing auditing of support operations. CX Experts conducts benchmarking and performance reviews of Zendesk usage
, identifies areas to streamline (e.g. workflow tweaks, process improvements), and implements enhancements to continuously improve customer experience. Regular health-checks ensure the platform and team are aligned with industry standards.
AI & Automation Strategy: As accredited Zendesk AI experts, the team helps clients leverage AI-powered features – from bots and automation for common inquiries to agent-assist co-pilot tools and AI-driven self-service
. They design conversational bots, configure Zendesk’s Advanced AI add-ons, and integrate third-party AI solutions (like Ultimate.AI) to automate resolutions and augment support agents.
Training & Support Plans: CX Experts provides training programs and fractional support arrangements, acting as an on-call extension of a client’s support team. Training services ensure in-house teams are skilled in Zendesk and CX best practices. Fractional support (shared or part-time expert agents) can be provided to fill gaps, with flexible plans that scale as needed.
Managed Services (SupaStack): Under a packaged offering called “SupaStack”, CX Experts delivers managed support services that bundle technology and manpower. This includes providing Quality Assurance (QA) analysts, Workforce Management (WFM) specialists, and deploying advanced Zendesk add-ons like Advanced Data Privacy & Protection (ADPP) as part of the solution. The SupaStack managed service is aimed at clients seeking ongoing, holistic support operations management, with CX Experts handling the continuous improvement of processes and tools.
Professional Services & Consulting: Beyond Zendesk, the team offers CX consulting — helping design customer service strategies, optimize contact center organization, and choose the right omnichannel approach. These professional services are often packaged into Service Plans or provided on-demand. In 2025, CX Experts launched new Service Plans and on-demand consulting offerings, supporting global brands like Just Eat under this model. (Notably, Just Eat engaged CX Experts for a standout project, underscoring the team’s capability to deliver at international scale.)
(Overlap Note: CX Experts focuses on technology enablement and advisory, working closely with digify BPO for staffing and operational execution, and leveraging Outbound CX for proactive outreach campaigns when needed. All brands share a core expertise in Zendesk and CX, but CX Experts serves as the strategy and systems engineering arm.)
Team & Leadership Bios
Phillip Batt – Founder & CEO: Phillip is the founder of CX Experts and CEO of the digify CX Group. Under his leadership, CX Experts became South Africa’s number-one Zendesk partner, recognized for driving digital transformation and exceptional customer experiences. He has championed the group’s expansion into AI-driven CX solutions and global markets. (Phillip’s LinkedIn tagline proudly reads: “Founder & CEO at CX Experts – South Africa's #1 Zendesk Partner | Founder at digify BPO – World's First Zendesk-Dedicated BPO | Championing Digital Transformation & Exceptional Customer Experiences”.) With over a decade of hands-on experience in customer service innovation, he remains closely involved in major client projects and in mentoring the team of certified Zendesk experts. Additional team members: CX Experts’ core team includes Certified Zendesk Consultants, Solution Architects, and Support Specialists. While individual bios are not listed here, the team doubled in size in 2025, adding exceptional talent especially in development and automation. This growth included partnering with the CAPACITI tech talent program to onboard skilled graduates. Through CAPACITI, a cohort of 40 young tech graduates began training as Tier 1 Support Technicians in late 2025, bolstering the group’s 24/7 support capabilities (specializing in Zendesk optimization, AI, and AWS voice connectivity). Many of these trainees support both CX Experts and digify BPO operations, reflecting the group’s commitment to nurturing talent. (Note: Outbound CX and CX Leads have their own leadership; see their sections for details. CX Experts works in tandem with these sister companies but is the primary brand led by Phillip Batt.)
Pricing & Engagement Model
CX Experts operates on a unique value-driven pricing model. For direct customers (those who obtain Zendesk licenses through CX Experts as their reseller), all consulting, implementation, and ongoing support services are provided free of charge – there are “zero hidden fees”
. Instead of billing clients for professional services, CX Experts earns a commission from Zendesk on license sales, aligning their success with the client’s platform adoption
. In practice, this means:
If a client chooses CX Experts as their Zendesk vendor, they receive a bundle of support proportional to their license spend. “The more you spend, the more expert support hours you get” – scaling seamlessly with the client’s needs
.
Starter, Growth, Enterprise Plans: CX Experts has defined internal service tiers by customer size. For example, a Starter Plan (1–19 Zendesk users) includes basic setup assistance and limited support hours; a Growth Plan (20–49 users) offers full Zendesk optimization and increased support hours; and an Enterprise Plan (50–99 users) provides unlimited support hours and advanced AI/workflow automation help
. All these plans are provided at no extra cost to direct clients – effectively free expert services bundled with software, a philosophy summed up as “professional services are BS (Billable Services)!”
.
For organizations that did not procure Zendesk through CX Experts (or have very bespoke needs), custom engagements are available. In such cases, CX Experts can scope out a Professional Services package or retainer. These are tailored to the client’s requirements after a consultation, ensuring even non-resale clients can benefit from CX Experts’ help
 (though standard hourly or project fees would apply in those scenarios).
This transparent pricing approach has been a differentiator – lowering the barrier for clients to get expert help and fostering long-term partnerships. It underscores CX Experts’ belief that helping customers succeed shouldn’t come with surprise costs
.
Testimonials & Case Studies
CX Experts’ impact is reflected in the success of its clients. They have orchestrated CX transformations for companies across retail, tech, finance, and more. For instance, Liberty London (a renowned retailer) and iStore (Apple’s premium reseller) are featured case studies, demonstrating how CX Experts optimized their Zendesk platforms to deliver better service. The team’s thought leadership is also evident in deep-dive case studies and knowledge-sharing: they produce LinkedIn “Ask an Expert” posts, YouTube tutorials, webinars with Zendesk, and monthly insights that showcase real-world results – such as boosting self-service rates or integrating AI bots to deflect tickets. Select Client Feedback: While specific CX Experts testimonials are often shared via case studies rather than public quotes, the benefits delivered are consistently noted. Clients credit CX Experts for reducing cost-to-serve, increasing customer lifetime value, and enhancing both employee and customer satisfaction through the solutions implemented
. In one standout 2025 engagement, a global food delivery brand (Just Eat) received on-demand Zendesk expertise from CX Experts – the success of which reinforced the value of having accredited AI-CX consultants on call. Across the board, partners and clients highlight CX Experts’ “friendly but expert” approach and their knack for translating business needs into efficient Zendesk configurations that scale for the future. (For additional client proof points, see digify BPO testimonials below – many involve collaborative projects between CX Experts and digify BPO, where technology plus staffing combined to achieve results.)
Mission & Strategic Direction
Mission: CX Experts is on a mission to help organizations future-proof their customer experiences. They aim to make world-class customer service achievable for any business by combining the right technology, intelligent processes, and skilled people. This mission translates into designing scalable solutions that “enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and build lasting customer loyalty”
. The team prioritizes clarity and actionable insight in everything they do – empowering client teams with knowledge (through training and documentation) so that improvements are sustainable. Strategic Direction: Going forward, CX Experts is focused on staying at the cutting edge of CX technology and AI integration. After a transformative 2025, the brand is doubling down on:
AI & Automation: Building on their Zendesk AI Expert accreditation, CX Experts continues to incorporate more AI-driven features (like predictive ticket routing, generative answer bots, and agent assist tools) into client solutions. The goal is to automate repetitive tasks and augment human agents, striking the right balance for efficiency and personalization.
Global Reach: Having supported clients on multiple continents, CX Experts is expanding its international presence. They frequently partner with Zendesk on global events (e.g. Zendesk Relate, Partner Summits) and have proven experience adapting solutions to different markets. Scaling up “24/7 follow-the-sun support” is a priority – which is enabled by the group’s growing team of trained associates and the digify BPO synergy.
Holistic CX Offerings: Through closer integration with sister brands, CX Experts can offer holistic packages: for example, a client can get Zendesk set up (by CX Experts), a full outsourced support team to operate it (via digify BPO), outbound call campaigns for sales or feedback (via Outbound CX), and marketing funnel support (via CX Leads). This one-stop-shop vision is part of the group strategy to deliver “continuous improvement” beyond traditional project scopes
.
Thought Leadership: CX Experts continues to cement its reputation as a thought leader in the CX space. Regular content (blogs, webinars, case studies) are produced to share insights. Topics center on trends like AI in customer service, omnichannel best practices, and success stories (e.g., helping a 125-year-old insurance company embrace digital CX). By educating the market, CX Experts not only builds credibility but also helps elevate the practice of customer experience management globally.
In summary, CX Experts stands as the strategic consulting and technology backbone of the digify CX Group – offering authoritative guidance, innovative solutions, and hands-on support to ensure customer experience excellence.
digify BPO
Tagline & Identity
Tagline: “The world’s first 100% Zendesk-dedicated BPO.”
Tone of Voice: Bold, innovative, and tech-forward. digify BPO’s communications showcase a cutting-edge approach to outsourcing, emphasizing AI integration, impact sourcing, and the strength of South Africa’s talent. The tone is confident and energetic, positioning the company as a disruptor in the BPO industry.
Brand Identity: The visual identity is modern and high-contrast. The primary color is a bright powder blue (#A0ADD6), balanced by a deep navy “Space Cadet” (#1F1E3A) for dark backgrounds. Accents of vibrant turquoise (#78EED6) add an innovative flair. digify BPO uses Montserrat (thin to bold weights) as a primary font, paired with Aeonik Pro as a secondary font for a clean, tech-centric look. The style features sharp contrasts, bold iconography, and imagery of modern contact center scenes with subtle gradients. Overall, the brand appearance conveys technology-driven professionalism and approachability (e.g., white and turquoise text on dark backgrounds for readability and impact).
Overview (Homepage Content)
digify BPO is a next-generation Business Process Outsourcer (BPO) specializing exclusively in Zendesk-powered customer support. Launched in 2025 as the world’s first Zendesk-dedicated BPO, it provides top-tier customer support and back-office services for businesses in the UK, USA, Australia, South Africa, and beyond
. The digify BPO model is built on deep Zendesk expertise: by creating a Zendesk Centre of Excellence, the company ensures clients’ support operations are optimized with best-in-class tools, automation, and processes
. At its core, digify BPO offers clients the ability to “outsource your contact center, without compromising on quality or technology.” All support agents and service teams are Zendesk-accredited specialists
, meaning they not only handle customer inquiries but also continuously improve the Zendesk setup (workflows, AI bots, knowledge base) as part of their service. This is a key differentiator: unlike traditional call centers, digify BPO doesn’t just provide people – it delivers a platform-driven service where the technology and processes are as much a focus as the human agents. The company also prides itself on innovation and social impact. It leverages AI-driven automation to streamline tasks
 and has embraced impact sourcing – recruiting and developing local talent in South Africa – to both empower communities and ensure a stable, motivated workforce
. The result for clients is seamless customer experiences across channels, delivered by a partner who acts as an extension of their business. With digify BPO, clients can scale their support teams up or down easily, trust that 24/7 coverage is handled, and enjoy continuous improvements from a team that’s “built for modern, automated CX operations”.
Services & Capabilities
digify BPO offers a comprehensive suite of outsourced CX services, aligned tightly with Zendesk and modern contact center needs. Its core services include:
24/7 Omnichannel Support Staffing: Provision of dedicated or shared support teams that operate around the clock. Agents are trained to handle all channels – email, live chat, social media, WhatsApp, and voice calls – ensuring consistent support on a true omnichannel Zendesk platform. With operations in South Africa (time zone overlapping Europe/Asia) and an accent-neutral English-speaking workforce, digify BPO covers global support seamlessly. This “follow-the-sun” model guarantees that no matter where a client’s customers are, help is always available.
Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS): Turnkey management of customer contact operations. This means digify BPO not only provides agents but also the infrastructure, telephony, and software (Zendesk Suite, telephony integrations like AWS Connect, etc.) to run a contact center. Clients avoid heavy investments in technology or office space – digify BPO’s secure centers and cloud-based systems handle it.
Technical Support & Back-Office Services: Beyond front-line customer queries, digify BPO teams can take on back-office tasks and technical workflows. This includes ticket triage, data processing, content moderation, order management, and other behind-the-scenes support tasks that free up clients’ internal staff. All back-office work is managed in Zendesk or integrated systems, maintaining visibility and tracking.
Zendesk Implementation & Support: As part of onboarding a BPO client, digify often helps implement or restructure the client’s Zendesk environment. They set up help centers, create macros, automation triggers, and workflow policies tailored to the business. Ongoing, they support configuration changes, new feature rollouts (like enabling Zendesk AI features), and ensure the client is using the platform’s latest capabilities effectively. In essence, every digify BPO engagement comes with built-in Zendesk admin and optimization support
, courtesy of the CX Experts collaboration.
AI & Automation Integration: digify BPO actively integrates AI into support processes. For example, they utilize chatbots and automated responders to handle common queries (often resolving a large portion of tickets instantly). They also employ workflow automation (e.g., using make.com or Zendesk bots) for routine tasks like categorizing tickets, escalating issues based on sentiment, etc. The BPO’s philosophy is to let bots handle the repetitive 80%, so human agents can focus on high-value interactions. Additionally, digify BPO explores advanced tech like AWS connectivity – for instance, using Amazon Connect for voice calls or AWS AI services to transcribe calls and analyze sentiment – thereby blending cloud capabilities into everyday operations.
Co-Sourced & Fractional Team Models: Flexibility in engagement is a key offering. Clients can have fully dedicated teams (agents who only serve one brand) or fractional agents who are shared across accounts when volumes are low. There are also usage-based models where billing is tied to ticket volumes or outcomes. For example, digify BPO can provide “fractional support plans” where a certain number of agent hours or resolved tickets per month are included. This is ideal for growing companies that need expert support without the cost of full FTEs. The co-sourcing approach also means the client’s in-house team and the BPO team collaborate fluidly – digify’s staff can act as an extension, not just an outsourced vendor.
Geographic Alignment & Language Support: While centered on English support (with neutral accents), digify BPO can align teams by region (UK, US, AU, or SA focused agents) to match cultural context and time zone. They also have the capability for multilingual support leveraging Zendesk’s multi-language knowledge base features and, where needed, partnerships for language specialists.
Value-Added Services: Included in many digify BPO engagements are extras like quality assurance (QA) auditing, workforce management (WFM) planning, and CX analytics reporting. For instance, digify BPO ensures QA by monitoring tickets/chats for quality and providing feedback, and uses WFM techniques to schedule the right number of agents for predicted volumes (preventing backlogs). In conjunction with CX Experts, they conduct quarterly business reviews and health checks for clients – analyzing support metrics and recommending improvements
. This consultative angle differentiates them from commodity call centers.
(Overlap Note: digify BPO collaborates closely with CX Experts for any high-level Zendesk configuration or CX strategy input needed. Many clients engage both – CX Experts to set up the system and define the strategy, and digify BPO to run the day-to-day support. Also, digify BPO’s focus is inbound/support, whereas Outbound CX (see below) handles proactive outbound calling campaigns; they complement each other and can cross-refer services.)
Team, Recruitment & Culture
Leadership: digify BPO was founded by Phillip Batt (also founder of CX Experts) as an answer to the question “What if a BPO was built entirely around the Zendesk ecosystem?”. Phillip continues to provide strategic direction, while day-to-day BPO operations are managed by a leadership team with deep contact center experience. Key figures include operations managers, training leads, and tech leads who ensure the integration of Zendesk and AI in service delivery. (Specific individual bios are not publicly listed, but leadership combines BPO industry veterans and Zendesk specialists.) Recruitment & Training: A cornerstone of digify BPO’s ethos is socially responsible recruitment and intensive training. The company actively recruits from talent development programs like CAPACITI, bringing in high-potential graduates and unemployed youth and training them in CX skills. In 2025, digify BPO partnered with CAPACITI to train a cohort of 40 tech graduates, who are now part of the Tier 1 support team specializing in Zendesk, AI, and AWS connectivity. All new hires undergo rigorous onboarding, including Zendesk certification courses, language and empathy training, and supervised apprenticeship on client accounts. This investment in people yields tangible benefits: “our commitment to socially responsible recruitment and employee development leads to lower attrition rates and better performance compared to onshore equivalents”
. Indeed, digify BPO’s staff retention is high, attributed to a positive work environment where employees are valued and can grow. The Employee Value Proposition (EVP) at digify BPO centers on empowerment and growth. The company fosters a culture of continuous learning, encouraging agents to upskill (e.g., learning new automation tools or AI skills). Standout performers have pathways to become team leaders, QA analysts, or transition into CX Experts’ consulting roles, which motivates the team. Collaboration and teamwork are core values
 – the environment is one where support agents, managers, and clients collaborate closely, and successes are shared. The BPO also emphasizes integrity and trust
; given they handle sensitive customer data and interactions, maintaining the highest ethical standards is non-negotiable. Importantly, digify BPO’s culture is infused with pride in representing South African capability on the global stage. In 2025, team members traveled internationally to events like Zendesk Relate and Customer Experience summits to both learn and showcase what the team can do. Bringing those experiences back home contributes to an ambitious, world-aware team culture. (In summary, digify BPO’s team is young, tech-savvy, and mission-driven – a deliberate contrast to the high-turnover, “call center factory” image of some BPOs. This culture translates into more engaged agents serving your customers.)
Pricing Structure
digify BPO offers simple, transparent pricing tailored to client needs. The model is typically based on a fully-loaded per-hour rate per agent, which includes all operational costs and services. This contrasts with clients’ in-house costs that have many hidden add-ons. For illustration:
An in-house support agent in the UK or US might effectively cost £25–£29/hour (US$32–$41/hr) once you factor in salary, management overhead, benefits, office space, technology licenses, training, etc.
. digify BPO, however, can provide trained agents from £12/hour (≈$14/hr) fully loaded
. That’s roughly a 60% cost savings (saving ~£15 per hour per agent) when compared to typical in-house operations
. This cost difference is achieved through economies of scale, lower base labor costs in South Africa, and efficient use of technology – savings passed to clients.
The standard offering includes everything needed: agents (140 productive hours per month each), team management and QA supervision, ongoing training, and account management oversight
. Also included is strategic advice and quarterly performance health checks by CX Experts consultants, at no extra fee
. Essentially, the client pays one hourly rate and gets a turnkey customer support department.
Multiple Packages: digify BPO typically presents a few engagement options. For example: “Agent Only” vs “Agent + Zendesk” packages. In one scenario, if a client already has Zendesk licenses, they might pay from ~$13/hr per agent for the service
. If they need licenses included (Zendesk Enterprise Suite, WFM, AI add-ons, etc.), an “Agent + Zendesk” package might start around $15/hr (for US) which bundles the software costs too
. These rates scale slightly by region (e.g., an Australian support hour is a bit higher at ~$21/hr due to time zone premium)
. All pricing is transparent with what’s included and what’s not. Notably, Zendesk license fees themselves can be included or excluded as needed (they’re listed as “What’s Not Included” if a client chooses to maintain their own subscriptions)
.
Outcome-Based Pricing: In some cases, digify BPO explores outcome-based or usage-based pricing. A pioneering concept the team has introduced is “Resolution-Based Pricing”, where instead of paying per hour, a client pays per ticket resolved or per customer issue successfully handled. This aligns incentives toward efficient resolution. (A 2025 whitepaper “The Case for Resolution-Based Service” detailed this approach, shifting from time-based to measurable outcomes
.) While traditional hourly models are common, digify BPO is open to such innovative pricing for clients who prefer to pay by results achieved.
Flex and Scale: Contracts are generally flexible, allowing clients to scale the number of agents up or down with reasonable notice. There are often volume tiers or discounts if a client needs a large dedicated team. A startup package is even offered for early-stage companies (see the “Start Ups” section on the site) with special rates to help them grow
.
All in all, digify BPO’s pricing is designed to be cost-effective and transparent, with a clear comparison to in-house costs to illustrate savings. Clients get the benefit of outsourcing (lower cost, expertise, flexibility) without worrying about nickel-and-dime charges – everything is bundled into one hourly rate that’s easy to budget and justify.
Testimonials & Client Success
digify BPO features strong testimonials from a variety of international clients, demonstrating proven results. Some excerpts from happy clients:
Thomas Framnes – GoSolr (Renewable Energy): “Partnering [with digify] has been a game-changer! The centralized ticketing system and powerful suite of tools they implemented have transformed the way we serve our customers from lead to sale through to support. The result? Happier customers and a support team operating at peak efficiency. We couldn’t be more thrilled with the results!”
Dawid Smit – The Courier Guy (Logistics): “My experience with the team has been nothing short of revolutionary. They provided exceptional support with Zendesk across the board, ensuring that we are using the product to its fullest potential. The team is always eager to assist and collaborate, offering fresh ideas and solutions.”
Head of Customer Service – IT Distributor (B2B Tech): “Their hands-on approach ensured the implementation process was smooth, efficient, and perfectly aligned with our operational goals. What stood out most was their attention to detail and commitment to delivering measurable results. They didn’t just set up the system; they empowered our team with best practices, training, and actionable insights, enabling us to maximize Zendesk’s tools.”
Divan du Plessis – Amplifin (Financial Services): “Their expertise and knowledge have been invaluable in helping us optimize our customer support operations. What truly sets them apart is their genuine interest in the growth and success of our business. They consistently went above and beyond to understand our unique needs and provide tailored solutions that drive our progress. We highly recommend the team to any organization seeking a dedicated and proficient partner in enhancing their customer experience.”
These testimonials highlight several common themes: efficiency gains, full utilization of Zendesk, smooth implementations, attentive partnership, and tailored solutions. Clients across different industries achieved faster response times, higher customer satisfaction, and internal empowerment by working with digify BPO (often in concert with CX Experts). For example, through digify’s efforts, companies have reported improved CSAT scores and the ability to scale support during rapid growth without customer service hiccups. One case study worth noting is Medihelp (a 125+ year insurance firm in South Africa) – in 2025, the group helped Medihelp confidently step into digital CX, introducing automation and modern support channels. While Medihelp is a client of CX Experts’ consulting, the operational execution and ongoing support likely involved digify BPO resources. Such collaborations show the synergy in the group: CX Experts designs the solution, digify BPO runs it day-to-day. The outcome was a legacy company adopting cutting-edge CX tech with great success. In summary, clients testify that digify BPO is not just an outsourcer, but a true partner that improves their customer experience in measurable ways. These success stories build trust for new prospects evaluating the service.
Mission & Strategic Direction
Mission: digify BPO’s mission is “to provide world-class customer support and back-office services while fostering socially responsible recruitment that values and empowers our employees”
. This mission underlines a dual commitment: deliver exceptional service to clients and their customers, and be a BPO that’s more than just a service provider – one that creates positive impact for its employees and community. In practice, this means every client engagement is handled with care and dedication, and internally, the company invests in its people and ethical operations. The mission statement explicitly notes that digify aims to ensure clients “never feel like just a number”
, reflecting a boutique, client-centric approach even as the company scales. Strategic Vision: digify BPO envisions itself reshaping the future of outsourcing. Key strategic directions include:
Deepening Zendesk Focus: Solidifying its position as the go-to Zendesk BPO globally. This involves keeping the team at the forefront of Zendesk advancements (e.g., new Suite features, Sunshine platform capabilities, integrations). The “Zendesk Expertise at its Core” philosophy will remain, so any client using digify BPO benefits from cutting-edge platform knowledge
.
Continuous Improvement – Centre of Excellence: Internally, digify has a Centre of Excellence approach where processes are continuously refined. Strategically, the company plans to productize more of its methodologies (e.g., creating playbooks for common industries, automation scripts, quality frameworks) to accelerate improvement cycles for clients
. The aim is to not only maintain high performance but actually improve KPIs over time for each client – turning support from a cost center into a competitive advantage.
AI & Future Tech Leadership: Embracing AI is a big part of the forward strategy. After initial automation successes, digify BPO will integrate more AI-driven analytics and workforce optimization. For example, using AI to predict contact volume spikes, or to analyze customer sentiments at scale and adjust approach. They are also exploring voice technologies (like AWS voice services or speech analytics) to enhance phone support. By being early adopters of emerging CX tech, digify intends to give clients an innovation edge without them having to invest separately.
Impact Sourcing & Talent Development: On the people side, the strategic goal is to train hundreds of South African youth in CX and tech. The partnership with CAPACITI is just the beginning – digify BPO wants to create a sustainable pipeline of skilled talent, which addresses unemployment locally and meets its growing staffing needs. This strategy will enable offering 24/7 support by rotating teams and possibly establishing additional delivery centers in other regions of South Africa or Africa for redundancy and coverage. It also dovetails with plans for “more South African talent trained, certified, and deployed into world-class work” as stated for 2026.
Scaling Internationally: While maintaining a strong SA base, digify BPO is eyeing expansion into new markets. This could mean sales offices or partnerships in the UK/US, or aligning with other Zendesk partners internationally. Given that 2025 saw many new international clients, the strategy is to leverage those success stories to win more global business. The company will continue sponsoring and attending major industry events (like Zendesk Relate, etc.) to raise its profile globally. The Powered by Partners approach (partnering with CX Experts, Zendesk, Ultimate.ai, etc.) will also grow – digify will integrate more third-party solutions to offer a one-stop, holistic service that can scale for enterprise needs
.
Productizing the Model: In thought leadership, digify BPO published a whitepaper on resolution-based pricing which signals their intent to challenge traditional BPO models
. Strategically, if this model gains traction, digify could pioneer outcome-based outsourcing at scale, which would set it apart in the BPO industry. The long-term vision is an outsourcing partnership where client and provider goals are perfectly aligned (e.g., pay for resolutions, not hours). This forward-thinking approach keeps digify at the cutting edge of business models, not just technology.
In summary, digify BPO is driving a paradigm shift in outsourcing – blending world-class technology, innovative pricing, and impact-driven talent development. Its strategy is to keep pushing boundaries so that clients get not just cheaper support, but smarter and more strategic CX support as the years go on.
Outbound CX
Tagline & Identity
Tagline: “Call. Connect. Convert.”. This succinct tagline captures Outbound CX’s focus: proactively calling leads/customers, making meaningful connections, and converting opportunities into revenue or retention.
Tone of Voice: Outbound CX uses a performance-driven and confident tone. The messaging is sales-focused and energetic, conveying assurance in hitting targets and improving conversion rates. Copy is often short, punchy, and action-oriented – reflecting the outbound telemarketing mindset (e.g., strong calls-to-action). The brand exudes competitive optimism, aiming to motivate clients that their sales campaigns will succeed with Outbound CX.
Brand Identity: Visually, Outbound CX aligns somewhat with digify BPO’s palette, sharing the deep navy blue (#1F1E3A) as a primary color. The accent color is a bright neon turquoise (#78EED6) which often appears as flowing lines or highlights on dark backgrounds. The aesthetic takes inspiration from modern tech sales: think dark mode styling with vibrant neon elements (symbolizing phone lines or data streams). Montserrat is used as the font, ensuring consistency and a clean, bold look. Imagery includes call-related iconography (headsets, dialing interfaces) and dynamic graphics like arrows or upward trends, reinforcing the idea of driving conversion. The overall feel is high-contrast and modern, fitting for a lean, results-driven team.
Overview (About Outbound CX)
Outbound CX is the specialist outbound contact arm of the group, focusing on sales and customer outreach campaigns. While CX Experts and digify BPO excel at inbound support and service, Outbound CX handles the proactive side – reaching out to customers or prospects for various business goals. Founded by a team led by “Cal” (an industry veteran with ~9 years of outbound call center experience), Outbound CX joined the digify CX Group in 2025 through a strategic partnership. This brought together Cal’s established outbound operation with the group’s technology and AI capabilities, creating a comprehensive offering. Outbound CX operates like a boutique sales/BPO firm: it runs targeted calling campaigns rather than large generic call centers. It’s performance-focused – meaning success is measured in leads generated, appointments set, customers retained, or sales closed. The team is skilled in persuasive communication and uses data-driven approaches to maximize conversion rates. Their motto “Call. Connect. Convert.” isn’t just a tagline; it’s their process: Call the right people with the right message, Connect by building rapport and understanding needs, and Convert by achieving the desired outcome (sale, meeting, survey completion, etc.). Based in South Africa, Outbound CX leverages the country’s advantageous time zone overlap for reaching Europe, the Middle East, and Africa during their workday, and can also target North American time zones in later shifts. The staff are accent-neutral English speakers, with training in sales techniques and product knowledge for each campaign they handle. Outbound CX often works with UK-based businesses as an extension of their sales team – in fact, the company prides itself on “Why South African outbound works” insights, noting high education levels, work ethic, and cost-effectiveness as key advantages. In summary, Outbound CX extends the group’s capabilities into the realm of active customer engagement and revenue generation. Companies partner with Outbound CX when they want to grow their business – be it finding new customers, reactivating old ones, or gathering market intelligence – without having to build their own large outbound team.
Services & Campaign Types
Outbound CX provides a range of outbound calling and outreach services, tailored to both B2B and B2C contexts. Key offerings include:
Lead Generation & Appointment Setting: Outbound CX can act as a client’s prospecting team, calling lists of potential customers to gauge interest and schedule appointments or demos for the client’s sales staff. They excel at quickly qualifying leads using a provided script or criteria, handling objections, and securing a commitment for the next step (e.g., a meeting with a senior salesperson). This is highly valuable for B2B companies looking to fill their sales pipeline.
Customer Win-Back & Retention Calls: For companies with lapsed customers or those at risk of churning, Outbound CX runs retention campaigns. Agents will reach out to past customers with special offers, updates, or simply to understand why they left, aiming to win them back. Similarly, they conduct renewal reminder calls or loyalty program outreach to keep current customers engaged. These campaigns improve customer lifetime value by proactively addressing churn.
Sales Campaigns (Utility & Telecoms, etc.): Outbound CX has expertise in running sales drives for industries like utilities, telecoms, insurance, and others where direct phone sales are effective. This can involve cold-calling prospect lists or upselling/cross-selling to existing customer bases. The agents are trained to adhere to regulatory scripts (especially important in sectors like financial services) and to close sales or get verbal commitments that can be followed up digitally.
Surveys, NPS & Feedback Collection: Companies often need to collect customer feedback or run Net Promoter Score (NPS) surveys by phone for richer responses. Outbound CX offers survey calling services. Their agents will call customers with a set questionnaire – for example, following an event or purchase – and record responses. Because it’s via phone, they can clarify questions and capture more nuanced feedback than an email survey. This helps clients gather actionable insights and also shows customers a high-touch approach.
Debt Collection Support & Payment Reminders: Outbound CX can handle first-party collections calls, acting as an accounts receivable extension for the client. In practice, they remind customers of overdue payments, negotiate payment plans, or encourage settlement of balances – all while representing themselves as the client (maintaining the client’s brand and relationship). The focus is on early-stage collections (soft collections) to recover debt before it escalates. This service requires a careful balance of persistence and customer sensitivity, and Outbound CX agents are trained in collections best practices.
Fractional SDR/BDR Support: For SaaS or tech firms, Outbound CX offers fractional Sales Development Reps (SDRs) or Business Development Reps (BDRs) on a flexible basis. A client might not need a full-time SDR team, so they can utilize a few Outbound CX reps for, say, 10 hours a week or pay per qualified opportunity generated. These reps will perform cold outreach via calls (and possibly emails/LinkedIn in a blended cadence) to generate interest. This is an outcome-focused service: the client is typically paying for a certain number of qualified leads or meetings. It’s ideal for companies testing new markets or needing extra sales bandwidth for a campaign.
CRM Integration & Outreach Optimization: Outbound CX doesn’t just dial blindly; they integrate with client CRM systems (like HubSpot, Salesforce, or Zendesk Sell) to log activities and outcomes. They can help set up efficient outreach sequences, use power dialer software, and optimize call times and scripts based on data. Essentially, they bring technology into outbound just as the rest of the group does for support. This means if a client uses Zendesk Sell or another CRM, Outbound CX will update records in real time, ensuring full visibility. They also refine messaging through A/B script testing and shared learnings (“when we phrase the pitch this way, we get 20% more conversions”).
Pilot Programs & Market Trials: Outbound CX encourages new clients to start with a pilot campaign, often targeting the UK market as a testbed. In a pilot, Outbound CX will run a small-scale campaign (for example, one agent for one month making calls to a select list) to prove results. They showcase metrics like contact rate, conversion rate, and ROI. After a successful pilot, the client can confidently scale up knowing the approach works. This approach reflects Outbound CX’s confidence in delivering results before long-term commitments.
Channel Partnerships & Reseller Commission Programs: Unique to Outbound CX is a willingness to work with resellers or referral partners – indicated by content examples of “commission structures for resellers”. This means Outbound CX might allow marketing agencies or consulting firms to resell their outbound services for a commission, expanding their reach. It’s also possible they have a network of independent sales consultants who bring in business and get a cut. For clients, this isn’t directly a service, but it highlights Outbound CX’s flexibility in go-to-market strategies and scaling through partnerships.
(Overlap Note: Outbound CX’s services complement digify BPO. For instance, a digify BPO client might also hire Outbound CX to call their customers for NPS surveys. The integration is seamless – Outbound agents can feed data back into Zendesk or the client’s CRM so that the inbound support team (digify) and client have a 360° view of interactions. The group can thus manage a customer’s experience both reactively and proactively.)
Approach & Performance Model
Outbound CX distinguishes itself by its performance-centric approach: it’s very results-oriented and often aligns its compensation or KPIs with client success. Key aspects of their operating model and pricing:
Hourly vs Outcome Pricing: Outbound CX is flexible in pricing structures. They can charge per hour/agent like a typical service, or on an outcome-basis (e.g., $X per appointment set, $Y per sale closed). In fact, they highlight “per hour or outcome based” fractional support. Many clients opt for a hybrid: a base fee plus performance bonuses. This ensures Outbound CX has skin in the game. For example, an appointment setting project might be priced at a low hourly rate plus a bonus for each qualified meeting. Outcome-based models are attractive because the client pays mostly for tangible results, and Outbound CX stands to earn more by exceeding targets.
Commission & Incentives: Internally, Outbound CX agents and teams are highly incentivized. They often have commission structures akin to a sales team. If working on a sales campaign, agents might get a commission per sale or conversion they achieve (funded by the client’s payments or an agreed plan). This drives a healthy competitive spirit and keeps agents motivated to hit numbers. It’s not uncommon for Outbound CX to run in-house contests (like, who can set the most meetings this week wins a bonus) – all contributing to a high-energy sales culture.
Quality and Compliance: Despite the push for numbers, Outbound CX maintains strict compliance with calling regulations and quality standards. All calls adhere to scripts approved by clients (especially for regulated industries). Calls may be recorded for quality assurance and reviewed. Agents are trained to be persuasive but never abusive or misleading. This quality control is essential to protect the client’s brand and to ensure long-term success rather than short-term gains.
Integration with Client Workflow: Outbound CX presents itself as an extension of the client’s team. They take time to learn the client’s product/service, FAQs, and objections handling. They often create a FAQ or “battle card” for each campaign with key points to cover. Throughout the campaign, they provide regular reports to the client – typically weekly updates on calls made, conversion rates, pipeline generated, etc. Clients have transparency and can give feedback to tweak the approach. This collaborative model means clients sometimes feel like they have an in-house outbound team, just without the overhead.
Use of Technology: Calls are powered by modern dialer systems to maximize efficiency (predictive dialers for B2C high-volume campaigns, preview dialers for quality-focused B2B calls). If a prospect prefers info via email or WhatsApp, agents can trigger automated follow-ups via integrated tools (the group’s make.com automations can, for instance, send a personalized email right after a call). They also utilize WhatsApp integration on landing pages (per content notes) to quickly capture interested leads into a conversation. By blending voice with digital touchpoints, Outbound CX meets prospects where they’re comfortable, improving conversion odds.
Experience & Longevity: The Outbound CX team isn’t new to cold calling – with nearly a decade of experience prior to joining the group, they have refined techniques that work. They bring that know-how to client campaigns, often advising on list selection or messaging. For example, they might help a client improve their call script or suggest the best time of day to reach their particular audience, based on past campaigns. This consultative angle ensures campaigns are set up for success from the start.
In terms of typical results, Outbound CX likes to share concrete metrics: e.g., “200 calls/day → 12 meetings” as a snapshot of campaign performance. They’ve published insights on why their South African outbound approach yields high success, citing factors such as cultural affinity with Western markets, relatively low cost per dial, and high enthusiasm of the agents. With each project, they aim to not only hit the targets but also to provide learnings and improvements back to the client’s sales process.
Mission & Role in Group Strategy
While Outbound CX may not have a formal public mission statement, its purpose can be inferred: to drive client growth by boosting customer acquisition and retention through proactive outreach, while exemplifying the effectiveness of South African talent in outbound customer engagement. The team is passionate about proving that outsourcing outbound sales can be as effective as doing it in-house, if not more, when done with the right people and tools. As part of the digify CX Group’s strategic vision, Outbound CX adds the “revenue generation” dimension to the group’s CX offerings. The group’s 2025 milestones included partnering with Outbound CX to form the larger group – recognizing that a holistic customer experience doesn’t end at support, but includes marketing and sales touchpoints. With Outbound CX aboard, the group can undertake end-to-end customer journey projects: for example, identifying leads via marketing (CX Leads), converting them via Outbound CX, onboarding and supporting them via CX Experts and digify BPO, then repeating the cycle with upsells via Outbound again. This closed-loop capability is a strategic differentiator for the group. Looking ahead, Outbound CX will likely leverage the group’s AI and automation expertise more deeply. Imagine AI-assisted dialing (predicting which leads are hottest to call first) or sentiment analysis on call outcomes to refine scripts – these are areas where Outbound can benefit from the broader group’s investments. Also, as the group trains more talent (via CAPACITI etc.), Outbound CX gains a pipeline of enthusiastic communicators to grow its team. In essence, Outbound CX’s mandate is to connect and convert – turning prospects into customers and customers into loyal advocates, thereby completing the customer experience lifecycle that the digify CX Group covers. It’s the spearhead for growth, ensuring that the exceptional service delivered by other brands has a steady stream of new customers to delight.
CX Leads
Overview & Role
CX Leads is the digital marketing and lead-generation arm of the digify CX Group. Initially formed as an internal agency serving the other brands, it handles everything from promoting the group’s services online to creating collateral and tracking campaign performance. While not yet customer-facing in 2025 (i.e., it doesn’t offer services to external clients), CX Leads lays the foundation in marketing excellence that can eventually be offered publicly as a service. Essentially, if CX Experts, digify BPO, and Outbound CX are the “what” (the service offerings), CX Leads is the “how” those offerings are marketed and scaled – both for the group itself and, in the future, for clients who need digital marketing support. Key responsibilities of CX Leads include: building brand awareness, generating inbound leads, and supporting sales enablement for all entities in the group. This encompasses maintaining the websites, social media presence, content creation, running ad campaigns, and managing the group’s CRM for lead tracking. By centralizing these functions under CX Leads, the group ensures consistent branding and message across CX Experts, digify BPO, and Outbound CX, and achieves economies of scale in marketing. Importantly, CX Leads is slated to possibly become a public-facing digital marketing agency once its methods are fully refined internally. The logic is: if CX Leads can successfully grow the digify CX Group’s own business (multiple brands, global reach), those same skills can be offered to external customers who need help with marketing their products or services – especially in the tech and CX domain. This could open an additional revenue stream for the group. But until proven, CX Leads remains focused on supercharging the internal brands’ growth.
Services & Capabilities
Currently, CX Leads provides a comprehensive suite of marketing services internally:
Social Media Management: CX Leads handles the group’s presence on platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook/Meta. This includes scheduling regular posts, engaging with the audience, and running targeted ads. They use tools like Buffer combined with Make.com automation to schedule content efficiently across channels. For instance, they coordinate LinkedIn thought leadership posts (especially from CX Experts’ leaders), sharing success stories, event highlights, and industry tips to build credibility and generate interest. They ensure each post adheres to the brand-approved copy and visuals guidelines, maintaining tone and quality.
Content Creation & Collateral: The team produces various content – blog articles, case studies, whitepapers, infographics, and newsletters. Drawing from the brands’ expertise (e.g., CX Experts’ case studies like Liberty London and iStore, or digify BPO’s whitepaper on resolution-based service), CX Leads crafts compelling stories and insights that can attract potential clients. They also create marketing brochures and one-pagers for sales (like SupaStack service brochures, or pricing cheat-sheets). Design work is facilitated by tools like Canva Pro, with shared brand templates to ensure consistency. High-quality visuals – mockups of interfaces, photos of the BPO facility, team photos – are used to humanize and add appeal to content.
Website Development & SEO: CX Leads is responsible for the group’s web presence. They maintain multiple sites – e.g., the CX Experts site (built on Wix) and the digify BPO site (also on Wix), as well as interim pages like Outbound CX’s Carrd landing page. They ensure these sites are up-to-date with the latest offerings, have clear CTAs (“Contact Us”, “Get a Quote”), and are optimized for search engines (SEO). If Outbound CX is expanding beyond a Carrd.co page, CX Leads will spearhead that web development. Content for landing pages (like campaign-specific pages with WhatsApp chat integration) is also within their purview. They coordinate any web changes with Phillip or dedicated web admins to ensure quality control.
Digital Advertising & Campaigns: To generate leads, CX Leads runs digital ad campaigns on platforms like Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and Meta Ads. They create targeted ads highlighting key value propositions (e.g., “Reduce support costs by 60% with digify BPO” or “Boost sales with Outbound CX’s expert team”). These campaigns are data-driven: CX Leads tracks metrics such as click-through rates, conversion on landing pages, and cost per lead. They also utilize UTM tracking and Make.com workflows to attribute leads to the right campaign source. Through A/B testing ad copy and visuals, they refine which messages resonate (perhaps bold statements like “AI-powered Zendesk solutions” vs. “Outsource your contact center risk-free”).
Email Marketing & CRM Nurturing: The group’s mailing lists and lead nurturing sequences are managed by CX Leads. Using tools integrated with Zendesk Sell (CRM) or other email platforms, they send out newsletters (e.g., “Monthly CX Insights”) and automated follow-ups to warm leads. All leads captured (say, via a form or event) flow into the CRM, segmented by brand for clarity. Make.com automation might trigger a welcome email or an alert to a sales rep when a new lead comes in. The team ensures timely follow-up – for instance, if someone downloads a whitepaper on the website, CX Leads will arrange a personal reach-out a few days later to see if they have questions (often handing over to Outbound CX to call, if appropriate).
Analytics & Optimization: CX Leads monitors web analytics (traffic, bounce rates), social engagement stats, and campaign ROI. They prepare reports that show each brand how marketing is contributing to pipeline. For example, they can tell CX Experts that a particular webinar brought in 10 qualified leads, or inform digify BPO which keywords are driving the most site visits. These insights allow continuous improvement. They also track visitor behavior – using tools to see how users navigate the site – to optimize user experience and content placement. Their use of Tally.so forms integrated with Make.com allows capturing lead info in a structured way and automating responses.
Internal Communications & Branding: On top of external marketing, CX Leads may also handle internal communications and culture materials (like creating employee value proposition docs, team newsletters, etc., since they have the content skills). They maintain the brand guides (like the Brand Overview Guide we saw) and ensure all outward-facing materials by any team member align with brand voice and design.
(Overlap Note: CX Leads intersects particularly with Outbound CX in the marketing-to-sales funnel. A typical synergy: CX Leads runs a LinkedIn ad campaign offering a free CX audit -> leads fill the form (managed by CX Leads) -> Outbound CX then calls those leads to schedule the audit. This coordination between digital and phone outreach exemplifies how the group covers the full spectrum. Additionally, CX Leads supports events that CX Experts or digify BPO participate in – by promoting events, creating sign-up pages, and following up with attendees via email and calls.)
Tools & Technologies
CX Leads relies on a stack of modern marketing tools, many of which are integrated via automation:
Content & Design: Canva Pro for quick graphic design and visuals, ensuring on-brand imagery for posts and presentations. They maintain a shared asset library (logos, graphics, templates) accessible to the whole marketing team. For more advanced needs, they might use Adobe Creative Suite via designers, but Canva covers 80% of needs quickly.
Web & Landing Pages: Wix is used for the main websites (CX Experts and digify BPO), providing a flexible yet manageable platform for content updates. Carrd is used for lightweight one-page sites like the Outbound CX page or temporary promos. For landing pages needing custom forms, they sometimes embed Tally.so forms which easily capture data and feed it into automations.
Scheduling & Social Posting: Buffer (a social media scheduling tool) is integrated with Make.com to automate posting across LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.. They likely schedule posts at optimal times and maintain a calendar of content. LinkedIn is a major channel, given the B2B nature – they may use LinkedIn’s native tools for analytics on post performance.
Automation: Make.com (formerly Integromat) is a crucial glue – it connects forms, social, CRM, email, and more. For example, when a form is submitted, Make can add the contact to Zendesk Sell, send a Slack notification to the sales team, and email the person a resource, all automatically. When a social post is made, Make can record its URL and metrics in a sheet for analysis. The marketing team leverages these automations to save time and ensure no leads slip through cracks.
CRM & Lead Tracking: Zendesk Sell is used as the CRM, segmented by brand (so they can track whether a lead is interested in CX Experts vs BPO, etc.). It holds all leads and deals. HubSpot isn’t explicitly mentioned in internal docs, but given the user prompt’s mention, it’s possible they’ve considered or used HubSpot for marketing automation at some point. However, current evidence points to Zendesk Sell plus custom automations fulfilling CRM needs. They do ensure that each marketing lead is tagged with source and campaign (via UTM tracking through Make.com) for reporting on what’s working.
Email & Communication: They might use Zendesk Sell’s Reach (an email sequencing tool) or integrate with an email platform (like Mailchimp or SendGrid) to send newsletters. The Monthly newsletters and insights posts mentioned likely go out via an email marketing service. For webinars or events, they could use tools like Zoom or Demio for the event and integrate registration data back to the CRM for follow-up.
Analytics: Google Analytics is undoubtedly on their websites to track visitor data. They also might use LinkedIn Campaign Manager, Facebook Ads Manager, and Google Ads dashboard for campaign-specific metrics. If using HubSpot (speculatively), that would also provide web and email analytics in one place. Regardless, CX Leads is data-driven, looking at metrics like conversion rates, cost per lead, and engagement rates to refine tactics.
In terms of team organization, CX Leads likely comprises content writers, a designer, a digital ads specialist, and a marketing analyst – small but wearing multiple hats. They work in tandem with sales (e.g., Phillip and any sales execs) to align on messaging and target outcomes.
Future Outlook for CX Leads
The near future for CX Leads involves proving its effectiveness internally, then potentially offering services externally. Concretely, this means:
Generating Measurable Growth: The group will gauge CX Leads’ success by growth in inquiries and deals. A strong indicator is the significant new client wins in 2025 – many of those likely came from marketing efforts. If CX Leads can continue to attract big-name clients (like how 2025 saw brands across different sectors trusting the group), it justifies expanding the team and budget.
Public Offering of Services: Once confident, the group may spin out CX Leads as a client-facing digital marketing service. They could then help other companies (maybe initially other Zendesk partners or tech firms) with social media management, lead gen campaigns, or content creation. This would open a new revenue line and also strengthen the group’s network (helping market others could lead to referrals back to the core CX services). The business plan hints at making CX Leads “public facing as well, once we’ve got some good results… we might make that a saleable asset”. This suggests by 2026, CX Leads might be positioned as a digital marketing boutique specializing in CX and tech industry marketing.
Alignment with Group Strategy: For 2026’s “scale everything” directive, CX Leads will amplify the messaging around AI, global expansion, and training – since those are strategic themes. Expect more content on the group’s AI capabilities (case studies of automated solutions, AI expert accreditation announcement), on international presence (perhaps spotlight stories of clients in various countries), and on talent development (like the CAPACITI story turned into a PR piece). CX Leads will thus play a big role in storytelling the group’s evolution.
Brand Differentiation: As the four brands grow, CX Leads ensures each has a clear identity yet fits the umbrella. There may be refreshed branding efforts – perhaps a new logo or site for Outbound CX as it matures beyond a temporary page, or updated visual themes as needed. CX Leads will guard brand consistency during these expansions.
Technology Upgrades: If not already, the team might adopt more sophisticated marketing automation (could be considering HubSpot or Salesforce Marketing Cloud if scale demands it). The mention of HubSpot in the prompt might imply plans or partial use, which could unify email, web, and CRM into one platform for efficiency in the future.
ROI focus: Being internal doesn’t mean laxness – in fact, CX Leads likely holds itself to high ROI standards since it’s essentially marketing a marketing capability. They will focus on high-impact campaigns (e.g., sponsoring Zendesk events gave a lot of leads in 2025, so likely they’ll continue that in 2026 since it positioned the group well). They’ll drop channels that don’t perform and double down on ones that do (for instance, if LinkedIn brings enterprise leads and Facebook brings few, they’ll allocate budget accordingly).
In summary, CX Leads is the growth engine fuel within the group – blending creative marketing with automation and data. It ensures that the excellent services of CX Experts, digify BPO, and Outbound CX get noticed by the right audiences. As it scales up, it has the potential to become another client offering, sharing the group’s marketing playbook with others. For now, it remains somewhat behind-the-scenes, but its results are visible in the group’s rising brand recognition and client acquisition.
Overlap & Integration Summary: Throughout all the above, the digify CX Group’s cohesion is evident. All brands share a commitment to Exceptional Customer Experience – whether it’s achieved by consulting on a better support platform (CX Experts), running a high-performing support operation (digify BPO), proactively engaging customers (Outbound CX), or attracting new opportunities (CX Leads). The group’s unified strategic direction is towards AI-enhanced, globally scalable, 24/7 CX solutions driven by South African talent. Each brand has its specialization, but they interlock: e.g., a client could easily use two or three of the brands in combination for a fuller solution. This one-stop capability is a unique value proposition of the digify CX Group. As the group’s mission states, they are “more than just service providers — we are partners that deliver added value”, treating clients’ success as their north star
. All content above is the single source of truth for the group’s website – ensuring accuracy, consistency, and clarity in communicating who the digify CX Group is and how it can empower businesses to thrive in the era of AI-powered customer experience.
